# Project Proposal

The proposal is a more elaborate version of your abstract. It should be 300--500 words in length (~1-page write-up) describing: (1) the project title and group members, (2) the problem/topic you have chosen, (3) why the problem is interesting, (4) what your data looks like and a rough idea about how you plan to visualize the data.

#### Proposal:

Project Tycho provides a great dataset which contains weekly counts of cases or deaths of more than 50 contagious diseases per city around the US for more than 100 years. With this dataset, it will be much easier to explore the epidemic spreads and preventions in the US from a historical view. However, due to the relatively large data size and its spatial and temporal range, it will be hard to reveal any trends or patterns through scanning the long table. Data visualization could provide useful tools and views for us to explore the dataset.

According to Y. Matsubara et al. (2014) and W. G. Panhuis et al. (2013), there could be three kinds of basic trends or patterns in the epidemic spreads and preventions:   

1) In a long range of time, some of the diseases were significantly reduced by vaccinations while others were not; some were reduced but revived later. This trend could be effect by the development of medical science as while as the general economical development (represented by GDP per capita). Visualizing the Tycho dataset as a time-serious data, i.e. using index chart, could provide more entire and detail information of this trend.  

2) Some of these diseases could have (seasonal) cycles and others do not. Using visual techniques of cyclic time oriented data, i.e. circular silhouette, could easily find the patterns of seasonal cycles of diseases.

3) Respecting the geographic locations, some places are more vulnerable to some diseases. With a map view as while as a tree view of disease incidences in different places (we will need to use population data here to calculate incidences) and animated across time, we can find this pattern much easier.
