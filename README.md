# INFSCI 2415 Information Visualization Term Project

## Project Description:

**Milestones**  
* week #7: abstract due
* week #9: proposal due
* week #12: progress report due
* week #14: in-class presentation, final paper due

The final project can be done by a group of 3-4 students. If you plan to form a larger group (four at most), please discuss your project idea with me before you submit the abstract. The total work should scale roughly with the group size.

All written reports should be submitted in PDF format.

The abstract is just a short paragraph describing: (1) the project name and member(s), (2) the problem you have chosen, (3) why the problem is interesting to you, and (4) what kind of data you plan to use.

The proposal is a more elaborate version of your abstract. It should be 300--500 words in length (~1-page write-up) describing: (1) the project title and group members, (2) the problem/topic you have chosen, (3) why the problem is interesting, (4) what your data looks like and a rough idea about how you plan to visualize the data.

The progress report should be in the same format as your final report. It will be at least one page including: (1) the project title and group members, (2) the goal of your visualization and motivation, (3) a preliminary description about your visualization design and any early results (what you have accomplished), and (4) plan for finalizing the project (what you expect to have).

In the last week of class, each group will give an ignite presentation (5 minutes each; 20 slides with each slide advancing automatically after 15 seconds). The final paper should be 4--8 pages in length following the ACM SIG format (http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). You should describe your problem, approach, dataset, data analysis, evaluation, discussion, references, and so on, in sufficient details, and you need to show supporting evidence in tables and/or figures. You need to provide captions for all tables and figures. You should also briefly describe how each member contributes to the total work in the end of the report. The final project will be graded largely based on the final presentation and paper. Late days will not apply to the final reports.

## Topics:

### Pittsburgh Bike Share

• Data(2015Q2&Q4,2017Q2) available for download.  
• Potential task: Visualizing Bike Sharing Patterns  
• e.g., analysis of bike sharing demand  
• why important? “rebalancing” problem  
• You may conduct a pilot user study to understand
whether your design works or not.  
• Other useful information  
• Weather information: NCDC API, i-weather and others  
• Holiday schedules: from the city  

### Exploring Regional Governance in US

### Project Tycho

Generate visualizations for exploring the epidemiological data from Project Tycho [VPGJ+13]  
• Download data from Tycho: https://www.tycho.pitt.edu/data/level1.php  
• Read the paper [VPGJ+1] to understand what information is included in the dataset. Skim the paper [MSvPF14] to get an idea about what could be interesting to show.  
• Potential task: Design and implement a visualization system for users to explore the dataset. You may conduct a pilot user study to understand whether your design works or not.
